After thinking a lot, I finally made it. Back in 2020, after graduating, I began working in my safe zone, Chiang Mai, the city that ranks as the ‘City that makes people fall in love.’ Lol 🌝\r\n\r\nDuring that time, I felt my life was very simple. There were only a few repetitive activities and routines.\r\n\r\n- Begin the workday with a morning standup meeting.\r\n- In the late morning, go out to grab coffee at a nearby café (most frequently at 8 days a week).\r\n- After work, stop by to jog and exercise at the CMU field.\r\n- Always hang out with close friends (regular spot is East Bar!) 🥹\r\n- The reward for a hard day’s work is treating myself to salmon sashimi and getting a massage at the spa.\r\n\r\nIt’s quite funny that upon reflection, I realize my hobby after work hours is — working well! 🥹\r\n\r\nLife in Chiang Mai goes on like this, and sometimes it can get a bit boring. But this year, I decided to make a change. I changed jobs and dove into life in Bangkok 300%. Life here has changed a lot.\r\n\r\nAt first, it was tiring and required a big adjustment, but I’ve learned many new things and met many new people. In the past, I used to think living in Bangkok was tough and YESSS! I think true, Lol 😂. Some days, I’m really tired. Tired to the point where I don’t want to do anything at all ! The city layout, the weather, and the traffic make me not want to live life. I don’t feel like going out for coffee like I used to, or even going for a walk or eating at a nearby place. (Sometimes, it might be because I’m just lazy. 😆)\r\n\r\nBut life wasn’t overly difficult. It became much easier when you have good friends, people you love, and who love you here. All tiredness goes away with a glass of beer with someone you love, while starting a short conversation during the day. 💚\r\n\r\nToday marks one year since I moved to Bangkok. It seems that I’m still deeply in love with Chiang Mai. Many times, I find myself thinking about it and even going back to visit often. However, I’m still here in Bangkok. There’s a plan to go back and live in Chiang Mai again in the coming years. Here’s hoping that Bangkok is kind to me in the next year!\r\n\r\n## Travel\r\n\r\nThis year, I traveled much less compared to the previous year. Koh mark trips (5 days 4 nights) was slow and immersive, but I very very love it. A trip focused on real relaxation.\r\n\r\n![Cape Tukata, Koh Mak](/src/images/blog/1/img_3185-2.webp)\r\n\r\nI nap every day on that island and watch the sunset every evening. Feels great not dealing with too many tourists. It gave time for deep conversations with my travel partner.\r\n\r\n## Career and self development\r\n\r\nThis year, I tried quite a few new things. I stepped out of my comfort zone to learn a language I used to hate during university class — Java. Surprisingly, it’s not as bad as I thought, and I discovered that I’m happy when learning something new. It’s just a bit tiring when climbing the learning curve. Oh! This year, I took my mobile app development skills to another level (React Native). It was a lot of fun!\r\n\r\nHere’s hoping that next year I continue to find joy in learning and developing myself like this.\r\n\r\n## Books in this year\r\n\r\nThis year, I only finished reading two books, but my favorite one is ‘Mesa La Tawan.’ This book that reminds me of a dear friend who has passed away. I cried a lot after finishing it.\r\n\r\n![Mesa La Tawan by September's blue](/src/images/blog/1/img_7776.webp)\r\n\r\nI reflect and think about the importance of people who are still in my life after read this one. Hoping that next year, I’ll have more time to read books.\r\n\r\n## Recap year’s goal\r\n\r\n- Reach the money savings goal 🎉 — I was determined to reach my emergency savings goal by reducing travel. Next year, in 2024, I plan to compensate for it by traveling more.\r\n- The weight loss attempt this year was not successful 😂 — Not surprisingly, it’s been a year of enjoying food a lot. Next year, let’s give it another try (again 🌝).\r\n- Invested in funds to meet the goal, including investments in various insurances. Gave much more importance to health.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"bg-white-50 italic text-gray-800 my-4 text-center rounded-md\">\r\n  \u003Cp>To those we had memories together: thanks for being part of my 2023.
